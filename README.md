Introduction:
This project was created as a learning tool to navigate JWKS and JWT when it comes to web based cyber security. Required by CSCE3550 in an assignment created by Jacob Hochstetler.

Getting Started:
This project uses the following -
-python
-flask
-jwt
-cryptography
-sqlite3
-datetime
-uuid
-argon2

Each phase of this project contains 1 driver file titled "project#.py" and a "testing.py" (which is updated at each iteration).

Features:
At the current phase, this project retrieves user data and stores it in a "users" database. Similarly, it receives authorization requests and stores it's data into "auth_logs" database. 

The stretch goal for this project is to implement the optional Delimiter function to limit auth requests allowed per time.

Authors:
This project was written by Monique Simberg with assistance of the CSCE 3550 and Leonardo Simberg in troubleshooting.
